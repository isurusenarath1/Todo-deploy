# Frontend to Backend Connection Fix

We've identified and fixed the issue with your Todo App's frontend not connecting to the backend. The main problem was that your frontend was trying to connect using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed HTTPS Protocol**:
   - Updated the API configuration to force HTTPS for all requests
   - Added a function to properly display the secure URL in error messages
   - Created redirects to ensure all traffic uses HTTPS

2. **Backend CORS Configuration**:
   - Updated to allow all origins temporarily for debugging
   - Added better logging for debugging
   - Added support for the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable

3. **Frontend API Configuration**:
   - Enhanced error handling in the TodoCountContext
   - Added visual error display in the Navbar
   - Added debug logging to trace API calls
   - Created a test HTML file (`api-test.html`) to verify API connectivity

## How to Complete the Fix

### 1. Redeploy the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd todo-app/backend

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Verify API Access

Check if your deployed backend API is accessible by visiting:
- Backend base URL: `https://todo-deploy-iota.vercel.app`
- API endpoint: `https://todo-deploy-iota.vercel.app/api/todos`

You should see "Todo API is running..." on the base URL and a JSON array of todos at the API endpoint.

### 3. Update Frontend Build and Deploy

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd todo-app/frontend

# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Check Browser Console

Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the console for any error messages. Look for:
- The API URL that is being used (should now be HTTPS)
- Any CORS-related errors
- Network request failures

### 5. Restore Proper CORS After Fixing

Once everything is working, update the backend's `index.js` to use proper CORS configuration:

```javascript
// CORS configuration
const allowedOrigins = [
  process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:5173',
  'https://todo-deploy-8xsv.vercel.app',
  // Add any other frontend URLs if needed
];

app.use(cors({
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check for HTTP vs HTTPS**: Make sure all URLs are using HTTPS, not HTTP
2. **Check Network Tab**: In browser developer tools, look at the Network tab when the app loads
3. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure the `FRONTEND_URL` is set in Vercel for the backend
4. **Try the Test Page**: Access `api-test.html` on your deployed frontend to test direct API connection
5. **Clear Cache**: Try hard-refreshing the browser (Ctrl+F5) or clearing the browser cache

## Root Cause

The connection issue was caused by the frontend attempting to use HTTP instead of HTTPS when connecting to the backend. Modern browsers block mixed content (HTTP requests from HTTPS pages), and Vercel automatically uses HTTPS for deployments.
